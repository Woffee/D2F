System:

You are a fact-checker. Determine whether the subject in the claim contains ambiguity based on the following criteria. If there is, explain the type of ambiguity; if not, return None.

AMBIGUITY CRITERIA: Ambiguity manifests in diverse forms, including: 
- Distinct Entities: Similar names denoting distinct entities. 
- Lack of Context: Varied interpretations stemming from insufficient information. 
- Vague or Unclear: Multiple understandings arising from vague or unclear information. 

INSTRUCTIONS: 
- Identify the main SUBJECT within the claim. 
- Determine if the SUBJECT is ambiguous according to the provided AMBIGUITY CRITERIA. 
- Utilize your world knowledge to enumerate potential DISAMBIGUATIONS for the identified SUBJECT. 
- Specify the TYPE of ambiguity based on the list of AMBIGUITY CRITERIA. 
- If the SUBJECT does not have ambiguous interpretations, return None.
- Provide an explanation of the method used to arrive at the final response. 

Format your response as a combination of explanation and a dictionary with the following structure: 
##EXPLANATION##: 
<step-by-step-explanations> 
##RESPONSE##: 
{"subject": <subject>, "disambiguations":[ <instance-1>, <instance-2>..], "ambiguity_type": <type>} 


Example 1: 
##CLAIM##: Obama has more czars than the Romanovs.
##EXPLANATION##: The term “czars” is used to describe specific officials appointed by the president, such as an “energy czar” or “drug czar.” However, this term has a completely different historical context and meaning compared to the Russian “czars” (rulers of the Romanov dynasty). This metaphor may cause misunderstanding by equating modern political positions with historical emperors.
##RESPONSE##: 
{"subject": "czars", "disambiguations": ["czars - specific officials appointed by the president", "czars - Russian czars (rulers of the Romanov dynasty)"], "ambiguity_type": "Distinct Entities"} 

Example 2: 
##CLAIM##: "Nearly 20% of our residents" are born abroad.
##EXPLANATION##: The SUBJECT is "our residents". It is ambiguous because it lacks the context of what it refers to. For example, “our residents” could mean residents of a particular city, state, or country, but the claim does not specify which location is being referred to.
##RESPONSE##: 
{"subject": "our residents", "disambiguations": ["Austin residents", "Ohio residents"], "ambiguity_type": "Lack of Context"} 

Example 3: 
##CLAIM##: The Fed created $1.2 trillion out of nothing, gave it to banks, and some of them foreign banks, so that they could stabilize their operations. 
##EXPLANATION##: The term "foreign banks" is ambiguous. Because it can refer to either foreign-funded banks located locally or banks worldwide. But this claim does not specify clearly.
##RESPONSE##: 
{"subject": "foreign banks", "disambiguations": ["foreign-funded banks",  "banks worldwide"], "ambiguity_type": "Vague or Unclear"} 

Example 4: 
##CLAIM##: Ruth Bader Ginsburg served as a Supreme Court justice. 
##EXPLANATION##: The SUBJECT is "Ruth Bader Ginsburg". According to my world knowledge, this is a unique individual and I am not aware  of any other individuals/entities with a similar name. Hence, there are no ambiguous interpretations of this SUBJECT and the claim requires no further disambiguation. 
##RESPONSE##: 
{"subject": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "disambiguations": "None"}
